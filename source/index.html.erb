       We played it in the evening, after dinner. Oola wore one of Mrs. Orbitson’s dresses, an unseasonable velvet number with a skirt that hazed the floor, the hem furry and teasing as a frat boy.

      Oola poured each of us a drink, choosing from the Orbitson’s expansive wet bar. We were like children with taped-on corsages, estimating our own depths, guessing at love. The windows would be open, the smell of the city suffusing the room. It ate at the curtains, warped the dark wood, did all the things we as house-sitters were supposed to prevent but as self-absorbed lovers found excusable.

      I liked to wear one of Mr. Orbitson’s grey smoking jackets. I put on sad music: songs with lost or heart or broken in the title. It was the kind of music that I used to love to listen to when I came back from a party, drunk and horny and alone. It could be Otis Redding, Maria Callas, Kate Bush, ANOHNI, some droopy-eyed teen with a broken guitar, a spinster giving herself up to Chopin.

     <em>Oola</em>, her name. A word that sounded funny when you repeated it, like any word said too many times. I used to do this as a kid, repeating my name or the words <em>book</em>, <em>bread</em>, <em>breasts</em>, until these most basic things sounded foreign and I could barely remember what they meant. <em>Oola</em> similarly cracked open on the tongue, like something cream-filled, a necessary embarrassment. It made one’s mouth suddenly suspect.

      We sat down on the davenport, each wedged in a corner, with an empty space between us. Then, when she felt moved to, Oola would put a pair of nylon stockings on her head.

     Through the stretched fabric, her features were blurred, as if a left-hander had been penciling her, smudging the last stroke as he made the next, a face not so much ruined as erased.. Her eyelashes were crimped, her nose squished, her mouth forced open, her cheeks Botoxed back. As best we could we made eye contact.

    Oola like the silvery streak on a photograph labeled PARANORMAL. I liked being looked at without being seen. The floor dropped away. The atmosphere was voilinish. My sit bones turned numb as I tried not to move, to fix Oola’s mouth (a pink postage stamp) in my sight. She could’ve been anyone as she sat there, my grandmother or my first true love, a fine, feminine smear.
